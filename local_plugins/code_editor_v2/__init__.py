    Code Editor V2 Plugin - Usage Guide
    =================================

    WORKFLOW FOR CODE CHANGES:
    1. READ FIRST: Always read and understand the code before making changes
       - Use search_code to find relevant code
       - Read the complete content of files you plan to modify
       - Understand the structure and dependencies

    2. PLAN CHANGES:
       - Identify the exact snippets to modify
       - Consider how changes might affect other parts of the code
       - Plan your changes before executing them

    3. EXECUTE CHANGES:
       - Use update_code/delete_code/add_code with exact snippets
       - Make complete, coherent changes - not partial fixes
       - Verify changes match your intentions

    4. VERIFY CHANGES:
       - Review the changes before applying
       - Check for syntax errors or structural issues
       - Verify all issues were addressed

    5. COMMUNICATE CLEARLY:
       - Explain what you changed and why
       - If you're unsure about something, say so
       - If you need more information, ask for it

    Remember: Think like a human programmer. Don't rush to make changes without understanding the full context.
