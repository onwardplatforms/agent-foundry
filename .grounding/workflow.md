Conversational Agent Creation Workflow
1. Initiate Creation
User runs a simple command:

bash
Copy
Edit
foundry create
Without specifying an agent name or any flags, this triggers an interactive wizard. The Foundry (acting as an agent) welcomes the user and begins asking clarifying questions.

Foundry:

Hello! Let’s create a new agent. What should we call it? (Type a name, or type cancel to exit.)

2. Naming & Purpose
User:

Let's name it “TravelPlanner”.

Foundry:

Great! The agent name will be “TravelPlanner.”
What’s the main purpose or description of this agent? (For example, “Helps with flight and hotel searches.”)

User:

I want it to help with comparing flight deals and hotel availability across multiple sources.

Foundry:

Got it. Agent Description: “Helps compare flight deals and hotel availability.”
Next, we can add any relevant plugins or tools. Do you have something specific in mind?

3. Plugin & Tool Recommendations
At this step, the Foundry can propose standard library plugins (from standard_lib) or customized tools it knows of.

Foundry:

I recommend including a plugin for web searching and a plugin for reading/writing code.

Web Search plugin: so the agent can search flight data or travel sites.
Read/Write Code plugin: if you’d like the agent to generate or update code in the future.
Would you like to add these?
User:

Yes, add both.

Foundry:

Done. “Web Search” and “Read/Write Code” plugins will be included.
Any other plugins you might need? For instance, a “grep_codebase” plugin if you expect big local code searches?

User:

Not right now.

4. Dependencies & Environment Variables
Foundry:

Do you need any additional Python packages, besides semantic-kernel and python-dotenv?
Some popular ones might be requests for HTTP calls or beautifulsoup4 for HTML parsing, especially if you’re scraping travel sites.

User:

Let’s add “requests” for now.

Foundry:

Ok, “requests” will be added to your agent’s dependencies.
Next, do you need environment variables like API_KEYs? If so, I can generate placeholders in your .env.

User:

Sure, I’ll have a “TRAVEL_API_KEY” later. Put that in there.

Foundry:

Understood. I’ll add TRAVEL_API_KEY= to your .env. You can fill it later.

5. Confirm & Create
Foundry:

Here’s a summary of what we have so far:

Name: TravelPlanner
Description: Helps compare flight deals and hotel availability
Plugins: Web Search, Read/Write Code
Dependencies: semantic-kernel, python-dotenv, requests
Environment Variables: TRAVEL_API_KEY=
Do you want to proceed with this setup?

User:

Yes, please proceed.

6. Scaffold the Agent
At this point, the Foundry:

Creates a folder agents/TravelPlanner/.
Writes a default agent.config.json with the user’s input.
Creates a .env with TRAVEL_API_KEY= placeholder.
Copies (or symlinks) the requested plugins from the standard_lib directory (Web Search, Read/Write Code) into the agent’s plugins/ folder.
Creates a Python virtual environment in agents/TravelPlanner/venv.
Installs all listed dependencies (including semantic-kernel, python-dotenv, requests).
Generates a minimal main.py so that the agent can be run.
During this creation, the Foundry provides real-time feedback.

Foundry:

Creating folder “TravelPlanner” under “agents/”
Writing “agent.config.json” with your details…
Creating .env with your environment variables…
Setting up a virtual environment…
Installing dependencies: semantic-kernel, python-dotenv, requests…
Copying selected plugins to agents/TravelPlanner/plugins/…
Done!

7. Optional Immediate Launch
Finally, the Foundry can ask if you want to launch the newly created agent right away.

Foundry:

Your new agent “TravelPlanner” is ready!
Would you like to run it now (yes) or exit for now (no)?

User:

Let’s run it now.

Foundry:

Starting “TravelPlanner” in run mode. (Type exit at any point to leave.)

(Agent’s interactive shell launches...)

Key Points That Make This Workflow Conversational
Single-Command Start: The user just types foundry create, and the conversation begins.
Human-Friendly Prompts: The Foundry guides the user step by step, clarifying each question (name, description, plugins, dependencies, environment variables).
Iterative Feedback: The Foundry re-displays choices and confirms changes before final creation.
Real-Time Updates: The Foundry announces what it’s doing (folder creation, environment setup, etc.).
Optional Immediate Launch: The user can jump right into using the agent or come back later.
Advantages of a Conversational Approach
Reduced Cognitive Load: Users don’t have to remember flags or complex syntax; they just answer prompts.
Discoverability: Users learn about existing plugins or recommended best practices (e.g., adding requests, environment variables).
Customizable: The Foundry can adapt to advanced needs, letting the user specify more sophisticated configurations or choose to skip steps if they prefer defaults.
Logical Progression: Each step flows naturally to the next, mimicking a real conversation rather than forcing the user to gather all info upfront.
Implementation Suggestions
Use Click to Start: The single command foundry create should open a “conversational loop.”
Technically, this can be done by reading user input line-by-line inside the create command.
Leverage LLM / Semantic Kernel: The Foundry can optionally use a large language model to interpret the user’s responses more flexibly—like recognizing synonyms or partial phrases.
Auto-Generated Summaries: The Foundry might dynamically rephrase or expand user input into a description or suggest plugin names.
Error Handling: If a user changes their mind or enters something invalid, the Foundry can politely correct or re-ask.

@click.command()

    use_web_search = click.confirm("Include Web Search plugin?")
    use_read_write_code = click.confirm("Include Read/Write Code plugin?")
    
    # Step 4: Extra dependencies
    extra_deps = click.prompt("Any additional Python packages (comma-separated)?", default="")
    # Step 5: Environment vars
    env_vars = click.prompt("Any environment vars needed? (e.g., TRAVEL_API_KEY)", default="")
