# Agent Runtime v2 Strategy & Architecture

## Overview
Agent Runtime v2 is designed to be a flexible, extensible framework for building and managing AI agents. The runtime supports both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and ease of use.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Clear separation between agent logic, conversation management, and plugins
   - Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
   - Modular design allows for easy replacement and testing of components

2. **Extensibility First**
   - Plugin system for adding new capabilities
   - Provider abstraction for different LLM services
   - Capability framework for agent specialization

3. **Context Management**
   - Centralized context handling
   - Shared resources across conversations
   - Efficient memory management

## Current Architecture

### Key Components

1. **Agent Layer**
   - `Agent`: Core agent class managing individual agent behavior
   - `AgentConfig`: Configuration for agent initialization
   - Capability management

2. **Conversation Layer**
   - `ConversationManager`: Manages multi-agent conversations
   - `ConversationContext`: Handles shared context and state
   - Message processing and routing

3. **Model Layer**
   - `ModelProvider`: Abstract base class for model interactions
   - Provider implementations (OpenAI, etc.)
   - Model configuration and settings

4. **Plugin System**
   - Plugin loading and initialization
   - Plugin configuration
   - Resource management

## Planned Enhancements

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- Error handling and recovery
- Memory management system
- Complete plugin system implementation

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Capability framework
- Multi-agent coordination
- Conversation state persistence

### Phase 3: Platform Improvements
- Additional model providers
- Security and access control
- Monitoring and logging

### Phase 4: Developer Experience
- Development tools
- User experience improvements
- Documentation and examples

## Integration Points

1. **External Systems**
   - LLM Provider APIs
   - Vector Stores
   - External Services

2. **Plugin Interface**
   - Standard plugin API
   - Resource management
   - Security boundaries

3. **Development Tools**
   - Testing framework
   - Debugging tools
   - Monitoring system

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Iterative Development**
   - Focus on core functionality first
   - Regular testing and validation
   - Continuous documentation updates

2. **Testing Approach**
   - Unit tests for core components
   - Integration tests for plugins
   - End-to-end conversation testing

3. **Documentation**
   - Technical specifications
   - API documentation
   - Usage examples

## Success Metrics

1. **Technical**
   - Code coverage
   - Response times
   - Resource utilization

2. **Functional**
   - Agent capability breadth
   - Conversation quality
   - Plugin ecosystem growth

3. **Developer Experience**
   - API usability
   - Documentation completeness
   - Setup time
